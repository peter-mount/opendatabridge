opendatabridge provides a standalone application & docker container that can be used to connect to a remote ActiveMQ message broker like Network Rail's [NROD](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php?title=About_the_Network_Rail_feeds) or Rail Delivery Group's [Darwin Push Port](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php?title=Darwin:Push_Port) feeds and submit them to a local RabbitMQ message broker.

The main documentation is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/peter-mount/opendatabridge/wiki) which contains full examples on how to connect to both Network Rail's NROD & the Rail Delivery Group's Darwinv16 feeds.
